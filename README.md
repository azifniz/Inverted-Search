# Inverted Search

A C-based command-line application that implements an inverted search engine to efficiently index and retrieve words from multiple text files. It constructs an inverted index using hash tables and linked lists, mapping each unique word to the files and frequencies in which it appears. The project demonstrates strong proficiency in file handling, data structures, dynamic memory management, and efficient search algorithms at a low-level system design scale.
